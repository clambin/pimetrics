NAME
    pimetrics.probe - A set of Probes to measure values from different sources and report them to a reporting system (e.g. Prometheus)

CLASSES
    abc.ABC(builtins.object)
        Probe
            FileProbe
                SysFSProbe
            ProcessProbe
            APIProbe(Probe, abc.ABC)
    builtins.object
        Probes
    
    class Probe(abc.ABC)
     |  Base class for the pimetrics probe.  Calling code should call Probe.run() to measure a new value.
     |  Measuring goes through the following flow:
     |      - measure()  measures a new data point
     |        ->  process() performs any processing logic on the measured data
     |            ->  report() reports the processed value to a reporting system (e.g. prometheus)
     |  
     |  When creating a derived class, at least the following should be overrideen:
     |      - measure() to implement the measuring logic
     |      - report() to report the measured value to the reporting system
     |  
     |  More complex systems may override process() to separate the measument logic from any more complex
     |  data processing logic.
     |  
     |  Method resolution order:
     |      Probe
     |      abc.ABC
     |      builtins.object
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self)
     |      Constructor
     |  
     |  measure(self)
     |      Measure one or more values. Override this method to implement measuring algorithm
     |  
     |  measured(self)
     |      Returns the last measured & processed value
     |  
     |  process(self, output)
     |      Process any measured data before reporting it.  By default, this passed through the measured data
     |  
     |  report(self, output)
     |      Report the measured data to the reporting system. Base method records the measured value. It can be
     |      retrieved through Probe.measured().
     |  
     |  run(self)
     |      Measure, process & report a data point.
     |      
     |      This method typically should not need to be overriden.

     |  Data descriptors defined here:
     |  
     |  __dict__
     |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)
     |  
     |  __weakref__
     |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)

     |  
     |  __abstractmethods__ = frozenset({'measure'})
    
    class FileProbe(Probe)
     |  FileProbe(filename)
     |  
     |  FileProbe measures (reads) the value of a specified file.
     |  
     |  Any processing logic can be implemented in an overriden process() method. The default implementation
     |  returns the full content of the file.
     |  
     |  Method resolution order:
     |      FileProbe
     |      Probe
     |      abc.ABC

     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, filename)
     |      Constructor.  Filename specifies the file to be measured
     |      
     |      Throws a FileNotFoundError exception if the file does not exist at the time of object creation.
     |  
     |  measure(self)
     |      Measure one or more values. Override this method to implement measuring algorithm

     |      Process any measured data before reporting it.  By default, this passed through the measured data
     |  
     |  report(self, output)
     |      Report the measured data to the reporting system. Base method records the measured value. It can be
     |      retrieved through Probe.measured().
     |  
     |  run(self)
     |      Measure, process & report a data point.
     |      
     |      This method typically should not need to be overriden.

    class SysFSProbe(FileProbe)
     |  SysFSProbe(filename, divider=1)
     |  
     |  SysFSProbe extends FileProbe for use in measuring single-line files in /sys filesystems.
     |  
     |  Since /sys values may be larger than needed for reporting (e.g. clock frequencies measured in Hz,
     |  rather than more user-friendly MHz, the constructor takes a divider argument to divide the measured
     |  value before reporting it.
     |  
     |  Method resolution order:
     |      SysFSProbe
     |      FileProbe
     |      Probe
     |      abc.ABC
     |      builtins.object
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, filename, divider=1)
     |      Class constructor.
     |      
     |      filename specifies the file to be measured.
     |      divider specifies the value the measured value will be divided by.
     |      
     |      e.g. if the measured value is in Hz, but we want to report in MHz, specify 1000000. The default is 1.
     |  
     |  measure(self)
     |      Measure the value in the file, taking into account the specified divider.

    class ProcessProbe(Probe)
     |  ProcessProbe(cmd)
     |  
     |  ProcessProbe measures values reported by an externally spawned process.
     |  
     |  Typical example would be to report latency & packet loss measured by a ping command.
     |  See https://github.com/clambin/pinger for an example

     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, cmd)
     |      Class constructor.  cmd specifies the command to run
     |  
     |  measure(self)
     |      Read the output of the spawned command. Processing logic should be in ProcessProbe.process().
     |  
     |  running(self)
     |      Check if the spawned process is still running. Useful to see if the Probe should be recreated.

    class APIProbe(Probe, abc.ABC)
     |  APIProbe(url)
     |  
     |  APIProbe measures values reported by an API. See https://github.com/clambin/pimon for an example.
     |  
     |  Currently only HTTP GET & POST are supported.
     |  
     |  Since API calls require specific setup, measure should be overriden to specify application-specific logic.

     |      Constructor
     |

     |      Call the API via HTTP GET
     |

    class Probes(builtins.object)
     |  Convenience class to make code a little simpler.
     |  
     |  Rather than calling Probe().run() for each probe, one can register each probe through Probes.register(probe)
     |  and then call Probes.run() to measure all registed probes.

     |      Get the last value of each registered probe.
     |      
     |      Values are returned in the order the probes were registed in.
